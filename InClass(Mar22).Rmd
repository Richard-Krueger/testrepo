This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
```
```{r}
mod1 = lm(mpg~disp, data = mtcars)
summary(mod1)
```
```{r}
b = 29.599855
m = -0.041215

mpg200 = b + m * 200
mpg200

mpg300 = b + m * 300
mpg300

delta = mpg300 - mpg200
delta
```
```{r}
mod2 = lm(mpg~wt, data = mtcars)
summary(mod2)
```
```{r}
b = 37.2851
m = -5.3445

mpg200 = b + m * 200
mpg200

mpg300 = b + m * 300
mpg300

delta = mpg300 - mpg200
delta
```
```{r}
mod3 = lm(mpg~wt+disp, data = mtcars)
summary(mod3)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
